        <h1>Poster in Motion</h1>

            <p>This is a project designed for 2023 Halloween Parade located in NYC. The theme that year is "Outside down, Inside Out." I made this static image and corresponding motion graphic piece aims to display in the public environment for promotion.  </p>

        <h2>Process & Experiment</h2>
        <p>The NYC Halloween Parade is an event held every year. During the event,  a lot of families are going to participate together, and the majority of people who are joining the parade are teenagers, that is why I want to make this poster a bit more playful.<br><br>

            The theme inside out, upside down is referring to the idea that you can be whoever you are on the outside, and you can transfer to a new form of you in this parade. This idea makes me think of those hero films in which they live an ordinary life but when needed, can transfer into their hero form. At the end, I put my focus point on the children, and taking inspiration from the flip book and spinning wheel. Cross match different traditional costume people and make it into a roulette wheel to make it more interesting. The background has a different texture from the costume. The choice of typeface is also referring to the childlike handwriting typeface, and the color palette is coming from the idea of this is a Halloween event held at night.<br><br>
        
       I also list some experimental poster I like, but did not used for the final ae piece with the mockup I made to represent how my design will look like in the reality.</p>
