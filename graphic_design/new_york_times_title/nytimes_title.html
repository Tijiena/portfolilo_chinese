        <h1>New York Times Title Design</h1>
       
        <p>This project asks us to select a few articles from the New York Times, and get some inspiration from the context of the article. Then making two versions of motion graphics for its title, one more graphic, one purely text based.</p>

        <h3>A Hacker, By Many Other Names</h3>
        <p>
        A Hacker, By Many Other Names is an article that talks about hackers who have a stereotype of stealing privacy information and breaking down internet safety. However, a hacker is also just someone who is really good at coding. They can use their power to educate or protect the safety across the internet, so we should link the negative connotation with the word, Hacker.

        <h3>The Moon May Get Its Own Time Zone</h3>
        <p>The Moon May Get Its Time Zone is very straight forward. Because the time on the moon is different from earth, and when we discover more information about the moon, the necessity of giving the moon a time zone increases as well.  </p>

        <h2>A Hacker, By Many Other Names</h2>
        <div class="two_image">
            <video  width="640" height="480" controls autoplay muted>  <source src="video/hacker_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            <video  width="640" height="480" controls autoplay muted>  <source src="video/imagery.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
        </div>
        <p>
            For this article, I centered around the idea of Hacker. The pixelated typeface choice, and the color choice is futuristic and technical. And for this, I tried a bunch of different effects after effects can do, so it is more basic. Because the context of the article mentions hacker can contain many different meanings, so I used color to express. And the color I chose is all bright and vivid, because I want to emphasize the positive emotion linking to Hacker.

        <h2>The Moon May Get Its Own Time Zone</h2>
        <div class="two_image">
            <video  width="640" height="480" controls autoplay muted>  <source src="video/moon.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            <video  width="640" height="480" controls autoplay muted>  <source src="video/graphic2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            <video  width="640" height="480" controls autoplay muted>  <source src="video/moon_text.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            <p>
               
            For this article, I centered around the idea of the moon and time zone. Trying to simplify the time, from daytime to nighttime, putting places from different time zones together in a graphic and easy to understand way is the challenge of this article title. So, I end on the idea of an electronic clock since it is simpler than a real clock, and since the number is inside the typeface as well, so when it transfers to text, it would make more sense as well.
