        <p>This is a project that aims to use flushies as outside controller for Unity Game. The controller used conductive thread to detect electric signal from human touch and sends this data to audrino, the progame used to code for these kinds of physical computing. Then, c# code inside unity is then used to process the data in arduino and trigger the reaction in the unity interface. </p>

        <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Team Size: 1 (solo project)<br>
        -code for detecting electric signal in arduino<br>-use conductive thread ,adafruit flora, and plushies to make outside controllers<br>-code for recorgnizing arduino information in unity<br>-code for displaying image and check answer when the count down turns into zero<br>-take picture for the plushies and make them into silhouette</p>
        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>My original idea is to recreate Whoâ€™s that Pokemon scene in the pokemon anime, which basically is using silhouette to guess what is actuarial pokemon. However, it is impossible to have so many toys like pokemon as physical controllers. So in order to make the project within my scope, I decided to make this game with three plushies. Three plushies are obviously not enough and way too easy to guess, so I band the plushies into forms that are hard to guess as silhouette. Just in case of the final product, I think the silhouette can be a lot harder. By observing others playing my game, most people guessed every one of it correctly.
