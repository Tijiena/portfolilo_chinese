        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <img src="image/me.jpg" alt="A picture of my self" id="me">
        <p>As students receiving a formal education, we are focused on a very <em>specific kind of knowledge</em>: factual, academic information we learn from our teachers and books. Sometimes this focus causes us to forget all the other kinds of knowledge essential for a good life. In addition to the intellectual progress I make in school, I try to recognize my personal progress. </p>
    
        <p>In my experience, it is more difficult to get to know oneself than it is to memorize new information. It takes many different skills to <em>maintain motivation</em> and <em>express empathy</em>. Because I am not a person who is focused on the result, I am interested in creative challenges. When I am drawing, I feel a sense of <em>comfort</em> and <em>excitement</em>. I have some familiar tools to work with- the skills I have learned and the materials I like- but each new project is unknown. In fact, I believe I have the most precious and lucky thing in life: <strong>something I love to do</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>When I made my first three-dimensional work, I was first very aware of all the ways I felt challenged by the new factors I did not consider in two-dimensional works. With three-dimensional work, you must consider the space around the work as well as the work itself. This was challenging, but I slowly found my intuition. In the process of making a paper sculpture, I saw how beautiful the light passed through the spaces between the paper and I realized how exciting this interaction is between natural light and three-dimensional objects. This was a lesson I cherished, however unsuccessful the work looked at the end.</p>
        
        <p>I am also a person who is encouraged by <em>healthy relationships with my teachers and peers</em>. I value strong communication and find that my conversations are <em>a source of confidence</em> and <em>meaning</em>. In traditional Chinese schools, it is unusual to question your teacher or ask for help. Instead, you are expected to take notes during lectures and avoid bothering the teacher. But, when I switched to a new school, I began to understand how powerful it is to learn consistent and open communication. My teachers encourage me to ask questions and tell them how I am progressing with my coursework. They do not blame me for my misunderstandings as long as I have taken the time to ask thoughtful questions.</p>
        
        <p>Communication with others allows me to have a <em>deep understanding of other thoughts</em>. This builds on though my life and increased my ability of empathy at the same time. Whenever there is a conflict happening between my friends and me, I will always be trying to put myself into her shoes and listening to her argument. By doing this, I realize what is the difference between our mind set which lead to this conflict. From sensing their emotion, I can point out my mistake, solve the conflict quickly, and provide it from happening for the next time.</p>
        
        <p>The truth is that I have seen people graduate from high school and worry they did not choose the right subject or the best university. <strong>What is the point in getting full marks if you cannot identify what you love?</strong> While academic concepts are often forgotten after school finishes, our personal development continues. Knowing myself and knowing what I want, is much more important than full marks. At the end of the day, I want to have a life in which it is not relevant to consider any regrets. I accept that I will make mistakes and I accept that I will face challenges, but I do not accept a life without <em>integrity</em> and <em>kindness.</em></p>
